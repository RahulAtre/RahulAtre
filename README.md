Glad you're visiting my profile 😇

### About me 👨🏼‍🎓

I'm an ambitious technology enthusiast currently enrolled in the Math and Comp. Sci dual-degree program at uOttawa. I have prior research experience developing a Separation-Reduction algorithm for enhanced computation of the Probablistic Transitive Closure (PTC).

Presently, I am interested in the field of machine learning (especially NLP and Transformers) and the technology-driven world of capital markets. 

### 👨🏽‍💻 Currently spending time: 
- Learning concepts in mathematics, statistics, computer science and its multidisciplinary applications in machine learning and finance
- Building a data science portfolio to gain expertise in numeric packages/toolkits such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, as well as software frameworks such as spring, kubernetes, and kafka.
- Completing certifications in FinTech to obtain practical domain exposure in high-frequency trading algorithms and low-latency programming techniques (C/C++)

### Contact 📬
